# Experiment — Example targeting (placeholder)

Hypothesis: A simple rule or model‑based targeting improves business metric X by Y%.
Primary metric: define (↓/↑)
Guardrails: complaint rate, support tickets per 1k users, NPS
Sample size (rough): compute before launch
Randomization: 50/50 at user_id (or zone)
Duration: 28 days or until sample size met
Analysis: two‑sided test; pre‑registered
Success: define absolute/relative lift; guardrails unchanged
